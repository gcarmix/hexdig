# HexDig



🔍 **HexDig** is a fast, extensible tool for scanning, inspecting, and extracting embedded data from binary files and firmware images.



Inspired by tools like **binwalk**, HexDig focuses on modern workflows, clear output, and hackable internals—making it ideal for reverse engineers, firmware analysts, and security researchers.

## ✨ Features



- 🧠 Scan binary files for embedded file signatures

- 🧩 Identify compressed data, file systems, and common firmware formats

- 📦 Extract discovered data automatically or selectively

- 🧪 Analyze raw binaries and hex-level structures

- ⚡ Fast scanning with minimal dependencies

- 🔌 Plugin-friendly architecture (WIP)

## 🚀 Installation



### From source

```bash

git clone https://github.com/gcarmix/hexdig.git

cd hexdig

mkdir build
